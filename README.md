Unity's workspace consists of various panels and views. Here's an overview:

1. **Scene View**: This is where you design and arrange your game objects within a scene. You can move, rotate, and scale objects using the Scene View.

2. **Game View**: The Game View shows how your game will look and function in runtime. It's useful for testing and playing your game.

3. **Hierarchy**: The Hierarchy panel lists all the game objects in your scene. You can select and organize objects here.

4. **Inspector**: The Inspector panel displays details and properties of the selected game object or component. You can adjust settings and attach scripts here.

5. **Project**: The Project panel is where you manage your assets, including scripts, textures, models, and more. You can organize your project folders and assets here.

6. **Console**: The Console panel logs messages, errors, and warnings generated by your scripts. It's a crucial tool for debugging.

7. **Toolbar**: The Toolbar provides quick access to common tasks like running your game, saving your project, and more.

## Getting Started with Meta XR

### Opening building blocks

After successfully installed Meta XR all-in-one SDK, you will notice there is a new tab called "Meta", this tab contains tools regarding Meta XR. In our case, for the first step we want to open "Building Blocks" window.

### Building blocks introduction

This is the Building Blocks window, basically all of the basic interaction and features that Meta provides can be imported from here. The first thing we want to do is import the Camera Rig, which is our player "body" in XR.

Please note that Camera Rig is only the headset representation in the scene, if we want to import the controller or hand tracking please additionally import the Controller Tracking or Hand Tracking on the scene.

### Our first interaction

For our first interactions we will try using Grab, Distance Grab, and Poke interaction. These 3 interaction is the most basic type of interaction in XR.

Import the afformentioned interaction from the building block window.

For the Distance Grab interaction, you may import it twice with different distance grab mode to compare the difference.

## Scene building

After successfully importing the Meta Features, you will notice there are new game object called `[BuildingBlock] Camera Rig`, one `[BuildingBlock] Poke Interaction`, one `[BuildingBlock] Ray Interaction` and several `[BuildingBlock] Cube` in the scene hirearchy.

Set the cubes position Y as head level (around `1 - 1.5` units) and align them side-by-side. You may give it a different color as well!. To test the interactions, approach the cubes, then try grab it using your controller by holding the **grip button** or by pinching it if you're using handtracking.

If everything goes as plan, you should be able to grab the cube!. Please note that currently the poke and ray interaction is only available for handtracking, but we will cover that on the next section!
